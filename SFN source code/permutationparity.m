function [p] = permutationparity(P,Dim)
% permutationparity
%   p = permutationparity(P,Dim)
%
%   Returns the parity of a permutation. A value of 0 indicates an even 
%   permutation, while a value of 1 indicates an odd permutation.
%
%   The parity of permutations with duplicate values cannot be determined
%   with this routine.
%
%   `Dim` specifies which dimension the permutations are located on. 
%   If Dim == 1 each column of the matrix `P` is treated as a permutation,
%   If Dim == 2 each row of the matrix `P` is treated as a permutation.
%   If Dim is empty or unspecified, if defaults to treating each column as 
%   a different permutation.
%   
%   Example
%       P = [1 2 3 5 4];            % An odd permutation
%       pP = permutationparity(P)   % Get parity
%       pP = 1
%
%       P = [1 2 3 5 4; 1 2 4 5 3];     
%       pP = permutationparity(P,2)
%       pP = 1 
%            0
%
%       P = [1 2 3; 3 1 2; 2 3 1];  % Rows are odd, columns are even
%       pP = permutationparity(P,1)
%       pP = 0 0 0
%
%       pP = permutationparity(P,2)
%       pP = 1
%            1
%            1

%   Let p be a permutation of [1 2 ... n]. Let G(p) be the number of times 
%   in p that a number is greater than a number to its right. For example,
%   G([2 4 1 3]) = 3. Note that G[1 2 ... n] = 0. 
%   A transposition of numbers in adjacent positions changes G by Â±1. Every 
%   transposition can be expressed as a product of an odd number of such 
%   transpositions. Therefore every transposition changes the parity of G. 
%   Thus the number of transpositions used to obtain p is always even or 
%   always odd, according as G(p) is even or odd.
